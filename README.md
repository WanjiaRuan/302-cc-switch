# 302 CC Switch

### Provider switcher for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, OpenClaw & Hermes Agent — the [302.AI](https://302.ai) edition

English | [中文](README_ZH.md) | [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

</div>

302 CC Switch is built on [cc-switch](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch) (MIT), the excellent open-source provider switcher. It's the same full-featured app, **pre-configured for 302.AI users**: instead of a blank slate, you get 302.AI as a built-in provider for every supported tool, plus the official endpoints. No hunting for API base URLs, no guessing at config formats — paste your 302.AI key, pick a tool, and you're connected. Newcomer-friendly by default, fully open to custom providers if you need them.

## Download

> **macOS Gatekeeper**: the app is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate yet. On first launch, right-click the app → **Open** → **Open** to bypass the "unidentified developer" warning. You only need to do this once.

## What we added for 302.AI users

- **302.AI built in, ready out of the box** — pre-configured for all 7 supported tools
  - Anthropic-compatible endpoint: `https://api.302.ai` (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, OpenClaw, OpenCode)
  - OpenAI-compatible endpoint: `https://api.302.ai/v1` (Codex, Hermes)
  - Mainland China node `https://api.302ai.cn` available for speed-optimized switching
- **A curated starting list** — official endpoints + 302.AI, no third-party clutter to confuse first-time users (you can always add any provider back manually)
- **Auto-updates** delivered through this repository's releases
